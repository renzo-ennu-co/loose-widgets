# Ennu Widgets

Widgets developed in ReactJs to be used on Ennu's external websites.

## Compilation

After development, run:

```
npm run build:widgets
```

If you have changed any widget, new files will be generated in the `output` directory. Be sure to commit those changes.

## How to use the widgets

After commiting your changes, you are ready to find your widget's script.

The widget's scripts are hosted automatically on the CDN:

```
https://jsdlivr.com/
```

So, let's use the following url template to find them:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo@version/file
```

For instance, the `potential weight widget` is hosted on:

```
https://github.com/rzmogrovejo/ennu-widgets/blob/main/output/widgets/potential-weight-CXlXV9Iu.js
```

That widget's script is hosted here:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rzmogrovejo/ennu-widgets@main/output/widgets/potential-weight-CXlXV9Iu.js
```

Just copy and paste that url script and use it wherever you need.

Happy coding ❤️
